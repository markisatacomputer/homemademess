====================

An image management tool for me.

TODO
---------------------

+  click-drag select
+  enable edit created date
+  import exif (client side?)

+  cleanup unsaved (aka image.temporary < Date.now ) from S3 
  +  cron?
  +  ~ jenkins?
+  Move editor into its own scope for reuse (in view)
+  model for derivative transformations
+  think about toning down(/gutting) dropzone styles
+  remove user admin & register
+  remove tags from editor when all uploads removed


Notes for the future
---------------------


+  continue unfinished upload?
+  save upload state on navigation?
+  view - all current tags
+  view - edit/delete images via socket
+  view - hide/expand top nav button
+  search - date range/exif
+  view - details including cdn urls
+  view - original dl for logged in user
+  view - download all


+  single socket channel per user
+  galleries - customizable
