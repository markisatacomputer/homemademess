====================

An image management tool for me.

TODO (before view)
---------------------

+  Finish upload on S3completion
  +  remove tmp files
+  cleanup unsaved (aka image.temporary < Date.now ) from S3 
  +  cron?
  +  ~ jenkins?
+  enable edit created date


TODO (in parallel with view)
---------------------

+  Move editor into its own scope for reuse
+  click-drag select
+  model for derivative transformations
+  think about toning down(/gutting) dropzone styles
+  remove home & user




Notes for the future
---------------------

+  image manipulation?  watermarking?
