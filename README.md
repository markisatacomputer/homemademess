====================

An image management tool for me.

TODO (before view)
---------------------

+  cleanup unsaved (aka image.temporary < Date.now ) from S3 
  +  cron?
  +  ~ jenkins?
+  enable edit created date
+  import exif client side?
+  fix double bubble - there's more than one listener


TODO (in parallel with view)
---------------------

+  Move editor into its own scope for reuse
+  click-drag select
+  model for derivative transformations
+  think about toning down(/gutting) dropzone styles
+  remove user admin & register
+  remove tags from editor when all uploads removed


Notes for the future
---------------------

+  image manipulation?  watermarking?
+  continue unfinished upload?
+  save upload state on navigation?
