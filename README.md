====================

An image management tool for me.

TODO (before view)
---------------------

+  Remove from upload
+  Finish upload on S3completion
  +  Save to db - 'temp' key => 0
  +  remove tmp files


TODO (in parallel with view)
---------------------

+  Move editor into its own scope for reuse
+  create derivatives in upload class
+  model for derivative transformations
+  think about toning down(/gutting) dropzone styles




Notes for the future
---------------------

+  image manipulation?  watermarking?
